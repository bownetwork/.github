## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We are a Minecraft server run by [Blast Off Waters](http://blastoffwaters.com).

🌈 The community can make pull requests or create issues on the public code to help us out.

👩‍💻 Our docs are [here](https://docs.bownet.xyz). Also, we are waiting to do more development on this, as I have other projects on Blast Off Waters.

🍿 We are a fully remote team for now, so we eat what's available.
